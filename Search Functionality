Here we need to apply the MapReduce design pattern "Inverted Index Summarization".  To improve the efficiency of index building, here is my thought: 

Since the index keys are not evenly distributed, e.g., some high frequency words, such as "the", can appear in lots of forum entries.  This will make the reducer that handles it very busy, and as a result, hurt the overall efficiency.  To avoid this, we can omit the common index keys that add no value to the final goal, e.g. the word "the".  This will save lots of processing time, while staying with our original goal (in most cases, words like "the", are not what we are interested in).
